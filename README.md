Hi there 👋

I'm passionate about creating web applications and bringing ideas to life through code!
I enjoy working with Flask and Python, and I have solid experience with:

    🐍 Python (my favorite!)

    🌐 JavaScript

    ⚙️ C++ (basic to intermediate level)

I'm especially interested in building web applications, learning new technologies, and constantly improving my skills.
Currently, I'm focusing on enhancing my backend and frontend development skills.

Feel free to check out my repositories! 🚀
